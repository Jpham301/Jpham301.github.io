# Why it is Important
It is important we keep Ethics as a perserved factor of IT as we try to culture an environment with trust, responsibility, integrity, and respect. We must ensure these aspects are perserved as we continue to advance IT and prevent any possible forms of damages. 

# Challenges we may face
However, there are many challenges we can face such as data management and privacy which are just as important in perserving. We must continue to study and research how to maintain a good balance without compromise.
